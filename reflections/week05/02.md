## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
one to one, one to many, many to many 
2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
Letâ€™s start from the assumption that embedding is the default and the primary relationship model for MongoDB. Every functional requirement should be satisfied, by default, mapping every relationship as embedded
3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
The last and most effective way of managing these relationships is using a third collection to manage the relationship. This process is common when you are anticipating several relationships, and are not able to effectively manage the adding and removing of relationships in either of the above designs.
