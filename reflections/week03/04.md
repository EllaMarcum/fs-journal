## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
observer design pattern can help â€” it enables one-to-many data binding between elements. This one-way data binding can be event driven. With this pattern, you can build reusable code that solves for your specific needs
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
 subscribe: adds new observable events
 unsubscribe: removes observable events
 broadcast: executes all events with bound data
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
